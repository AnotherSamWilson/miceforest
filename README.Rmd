## miceforest: Fast Imputation with Random Forests in Python

<a href='https://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/icon.png' align="right" height="300" /></a>

Fast, memory efficient Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) with random forests. It can impute categorical and numeric data without much setup, and has an array of diagnostic plots available. The R version of this package may be found [here](https://github.com/FarrellDay/miceRanger).  
  

This document contains a thorough walkthrough of the package, benchmarks, and an introduction to multiple imputation. More information on MICE can be found in Stef van Buuren's excellent online book, which you can find [here](https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/ch-introduction.html).

### Package Meta  
miceforest has 4 main classes which the user will interact with:

  * ```KernelDataSet``` - a kernel data set is a dataset on which the mice algorithm is performed. Models are saved inside the instance, which can also be called on to impute new data. Several plotting methods are included to run diagnostics on the imputed data.  
  * ```MultipleImputedKernel``` - a collection of ```KernelDataSet```s. Has additional methods for accessing and comparing multiple kernel datasets together.  
  * ```ImputedDataSet``` - a single dataset that has been imputed. These are returned after ```impute_new_data()``` is called.
  * ```MultipleImputedDataSet``` - A collection of datasets that have been imputed. Has additional methods for comparing the imputations between datasets.  
  
This package can be installed using either pip or conda, through conda-forge:

``` {bash INSTALL1,eval=FALSE}
# Using pip
$ pip install miceforest

# Using conda
$ conda install -c conda-forge miceforest
```

You can also download the latest development version from this
repository. If you want to install from github with conda, you 
must first run ```conda install pip git```.

``` {bash INSTALL2,eval=FALSE}
$ pip install git+https://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest.git
```  
  
## Using miceforest  
  
We will be looking at a few simple examples of
imputation. We need to load the packages, and define the data:

``` {python SETUP}
import miceforest as mf
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load data and introduce missing values
iris = pd.concat(load_iris(as_frame=True,return_X_y=True),axis=1)
iris['target'] = iris['target'].astype('category')
iris_amp = mf.ampute_data(iris,perc=0.25,random_state=1991)
```


### Imputing a Single Dataset  
If you only want to create a single imputed dataset, you can use ```KernelDataSet```:
``` {python SIMPLEKERNEL}
# Create kernel. 
kds = mf.KernelDataSet(
  iris_amp,
  save_all_iterations=True,
  random_state=1991
)

# Run the MICE algorithm for 3 iterations
kds.mice(3)

# Return the completed kernel data
completed_data = kds.complete_data()
```  
There are also an array of plotting functions available, these are discussed below in the section [Diagnostic Plotting](https://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest#Diagnostic-Plotting). The plotting behavior between
single imputed datasets and multi-imputed datasets is slightly different.

### Simple Example of Multiple Imputation
We can also create a class which contains multiple ```KernelDataSet```s, along with easy ways to compare them:
``` {python SIMPLEEXAMPLE}
# Create kernel. 
kernel = mf.MultipleImputedKernel(
  iris_amp,
  datasets=4,
  save_all_iterations=True,
  random_state=1991
)

# Run the MICE algorithm for 3 iterations on each of the datasets
kernel.mice(3)
```

Printing the `MultipleImputedKernel` object will tell you some high level information:
``` {python PRINTKERNEL}
print(kernel)
```  

### Controlling Tree Growth
A *very* nice thing about random forests is that they are trivially parallelizable.
We can save a lot of time by setting the `n_jobs` parameter in both the fit and
predict methods for the random forests:
``` {python TREEGROWTH}
# Run the MICE algorithm for 2 more iterations on the kernel 
kernel.mice(2,n_jobs=2)
```

Any other arguments may be passed to either class (`RandomForestClassifier`,`RandomForestRegressor`). 
In our example, we may not have saved much (if any) time. This is because there is overhead
with using multiple cores, and our data is very small. 

### Creating a Custom Imputation Schema

It is possible to customize our imputation procedure by variable. By
passing a named list to `variable_schema`, you can specify the predictors for each
variable to impute. You can also select which variables should be
imputed using mean matching, as well as the mean matching candidates, by
passing a dict to`mean_match_candidates`:

``` {python CUSTOMSCHEMA}
var_sch = {
    'sepal width (cm)': ['target','petal width (cm)'],
    'petal width (cm)': ['target','sepal length (cm)']
}
var_mmc = {
    'sepal width (cm)': 5,
    'petal width (cm)': 0
}

cust_kernel = mf.MultipleImputedKernel(
    iris_amp,
    datasets=3,
    variable_schema=var_sch,
    mean_match_candidates=var_mmc
)
cust_kernel.mice(2)
```

### Imputing New Data with Existing Models

Multiple Imputation can take a long time. If you wish to impute a
dataset using the MICE algorithm, but donâ€™t have time to train new
models, it is possible to impute new datasets using a `MultipleImputedKernel` object.
The `impute_new_data()` function uses the random forests collected by `MultipleImputedKernel`
to perform multiple imputation without updating the random forest at
each iteration:

``` {python IMPUTENEWDATA}
# Our 'new data' is just the first 15 rows of iris_amp
new_data = iris_amp.iloc[range(15)]
new_data_imputed = kernel.impute_new_data(new_data=new_data)
print(new_data_imputed)
```

All of the imputation parameters (variable_schema, mean_match_candidates, etc) will be
carried over from the original `MultipleImputedKernel` object. When mean matching,
the candidate values are pulled from the original kernel dataset. To impute new data,
the ```save_models``` parameter in ```MultipleImputedKernel``` must be > 0. If 
```save_models == 1```, the model from the latest iteration is saved for each variable.
If ```save_models > 1```, the model from each iteration is saved. This allows for new
data to be imputed in a more similar fashion to the original mice procedure.

## Diagnostic Plotting

As of now, miceforest has four diagnostic plots available.

### Distribution of Imputed-Values  
We probably want to know how the imputed values are distributed. We can
plot the original distribution beside the imputed distributions in each 
dataset by using the `plot_imputed_distributions` method of an
`MultipleImputedKernel` object:
``` {python PLOT_DIST,eval=FALSE}
kernel.plot_imputed_distributions(wspace=0.3,hspace=0.3)
```
```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/distributions.png")
```  

The red line is the original data, and each black line are the imputed
values of each dataset.

### Convergence of Correlation  
  
We are probably interested in knowing how our values between datasets
converged over the iterations. The `plot_correlations` method shows you
a boxplot of the correlations between imputed values in every
combination of datasets, at each iteration. This allows you to see how
correlated the imputations are between datasets, as well as the convergence
over iterations:

``` {python PLOT_CORRCONVERGENCE,eval=FALSE}
kernel.plot_correlations()
```
```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/plot_corr.png")
```

### Variable Importance  
We also may be interested in which variables were used to impute each variable. We can
plot this information by using the `plot_feature_importance` method.  
``` {python PLOT_FEATIMP,eval=FALSE}
kernel.plot_feature_importance(annot=True,cmap="YlGnBu",vmin=0, vmax=1)
```
```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/var_imp.png")
```

The numbers shown are returned from the sklearn random forest `_feature_importance` attribute. Each square represents the importance of the column variable in imputing the row variable.  

### Mean Convergence  
If our data is not missing completely at random, we may see that it takes a few iterations for our models to get the distribution of imputations right.
We can plot the average value of our imputations to see if this is occurring:
``` {python PLOT_MEANCON,eval=FALSE}
kernel.plot_mean_convergence(wspace=0.3, hspace=0.4)
```
```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/mean_convergence.png")
```  
  
Our data was missing completely at random, so we don't see any convergence occurring here.

## Using the Imputed Data

To return the imputed data simply use the `complete_data` method:
```{python completeData}
dataset_1 = kernel.complete_data(0)
```  
This will return a single specified dataset. Multiple datasets are typically created so that
some measure of confidence around each prediction can be created.  
  
Since we know what the original data looked like, we can cheat and see how well the imputations
compare to the original data:
```{python IMP_PERFORMANCE}
acclist = []
for iteration in range(kernel.iteration_count()+1):
    target_na_count = kernel.na_counts['target']
    compdat = kernel.complete_data(dataset=0,iteration=iteration)
    
    # Record the accuract of the imputations of target.
    acclist.append(
      round(1-sum(compdat['target'] != iris['target'])/target_na_count,2)
    )

# acclist shows the accuracy of the imputations
# over the iterations.
print(acclist)
```
In this instance, we went from a ~32% accuracy (which is expected with random sampling) to an accuracy of
~86%. We managed to replace the missing `target` values with a pretty high degree of accuracy!

  
## The MICE Algorithm
Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations 'fills in' (imputes) missing data in a dataset through an iterative series of predictive models. In each iteration, each specified variable in the dataset is imputed using the other variables in the dataset. These iterations should be run until it appears that convergence has been met.  

  
```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/MICEalgorithm.png")
```  

This process is continued until all specified variables have been imputed. Additional iterations can be run if it appears that the average imputed values have not converged, although no more than 5 iterations are usually necessary.


### Common Use Cases  
##### **Data Leakage:**  
MICE is particularly useful if missing values are associated with the target variable in a way that introduces leakage. For instance, let's say you wanted to model customer retention at the time of sign up. A certain variable is collected at sign up or 1 month after sign up. The absence of that variable is a data leak, since it tells you that the customer did not retain for 1 month.

##### **Funnel Analysis:**  
Information is often collected at different stages of a 'funnel'. MICE can be used to make educated guesses about the characteristics of entities at different points in a funnel.  

##### **Confidence Intervals:**  
MICE can be used to impute missing values, however it is important to keep in mind that these imputed values are a prediction. Creating multiple datasets with different imputed values allows you to do two types of inference:  

* Imputed Value Distribution: A profile can be built for each imputed value, allowing you to make statements about the likely distribution of that value.  
* Model Prediction Distribution: With multiple datasets, you can build multiple models and create a distribution of predictions for each sample. Those samples with imputed values which were not able to be imputed with much confidence would have a larger variance in their predictions.  
  

### Predictive Mean Matching
```miceforest``` can make use of a procedure called predictive mean matching (PMM) to select which values are imputed. PMM involves selecting a datapoint from the original, nonmissing data which has a predicted value close to the predicted value of the missing sample. The closest N (```mean_match_candidates``` parameter) values are chosen as candidates, from which a value is chosen at random. This can be specified on a column-by-column basis. Going into more detail from our example above, we see how this works in practice:  

  
```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/PMM.png")
```  
  

This method is very useful if you have a variable which needs imputing which has any of the following characteristics:  

* Multimodal  
* Integer  
* Skewed  
  
### Effects of Mean Matching  
As an example, let's construct a dataset with some of the above characteristics:
```{python FAKEDATA, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8,eval=FALSE}
randst = np.random.RandomState(1991)
# random uniform variable
nrws = 1000
uniform_vec = randst.uniform(size=nrws)

def make_bimodal(mean1,mean2,size):
    bimodal_1 = randst.normal(size=nrws, loc=mean1)
    bimodal_2 = randst.normal(size=nrws, loc=mean2)
    bimdvec = []
    for i in range(size):
        bimdvec.append(randst.choice([bimodal_1[i], bimodal_2[i]]))
    return np.array(bimdvec)

# Make 2 Bimodal Variables
close_bimodal_vec = make_bimodal(2,-2,nrws)
far_bimodal_vec = make_bimodal(3,-3,nrws)


# Highly skewed variable correlated with Uniform_Variable
skewed_vec = np.exp(uniform_vec*randst.uniform(size=nrws)*3) + randst.uniform(size=nrws)*3

# Integer variable correlated with Close_Bimodal_Variable and Uniform_Variable
integer_vec = np.round(uniform_vec + close_bimodal_vec/3 + randst.uniform(size=nrws)*2)

# Make a DataFrame
dat = pd.DataFrame(
    {
    'uniform_var':uniform_vec,
    'close_bimodal_var':close_bimodal_vec,
    'far_bimodal_var':far_bimodal_vec,
    'skewed_var':skewed_vec,
    'integer_var':integer_vec
    }
)

# Ampute the data.
ampdat = mf.ampute_data(dat,perc=0.25,random_state=randst)

# Plot the original data
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
g = sns.PairGrid(dat)
g.map(plt.scatter,s=5)
```
```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width='600px'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/dataset.png")
```  
We can see how our variables are distributed and correlated in the graph above. Now let's run our imputation process twice, once using mean matching, and once using the model prediction.  
```{r,eval=FALSE}
kernelmeanmatch <- mf.MultipleImputedKernel(ampdat,mean_match_candidates=5)
kernelmodeloutput <- mf.MultipleImputedKernel(ampdat,mean_match_candidates=0)

kernelmeanmatch.mice(5)
kernelmodeloutput.mice(5)
```  

Let's look at the effect on the different variables.

##### With Mean Matching
```{python,eval=FALSE}
kernelmeanmatch.plot_imputed_distributions(wspace=0.2,hspace=0.4)
```
```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width='600px'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/meanmatcheffects.png")
```  

##### Without Mean Matching
``` {python,eval=FALSE}
kernelmodeloutput.plot_imputed_distributions(wspace=0.2,hspace=0.4)
```
```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width='600px'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/nomeanmatching.png")
```  

You can see the effects that mean matching has, depending on the distribution of the data. 
Simply returning the value from the model prediction, while it may provide a better 'fit',
will not provide imputations with a similair distribution to the original. This may be
beneficial, depending on your goal.
