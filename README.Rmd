## Package Meta  


### Installation
This package can be installed using either pip or conda, through conda-forge:

``` {bash INSTALL1,eval=FALSE}
# Using pip
$ pip install miceforest --no-cache-dir

# Using conda
$ conda install -c conda-forge miceforest
```

You can also download the latest development version from this
repository. If you want to install from github with conda, you 
must first run ```conda install pip git```.

``` {bash INSTALL2,eval=FALSE}
$ pip install git+https://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest.git
```  
  
### Classes
miceforest has 2 main classes which the user will interact with:

  * ```ImputationKernel``` - This class contains the raw data off of which the `mice` algorithm is performed. During this process, models will be trained, and the imputed (predicted) values will be stored. These values can be used to fill in the missing values of the raw data. The raw data can be copied, or referenced directly. Models can be saved, and used to impute new datasets.
  * ```ImputedData``` - The result of `ImputationKernel.impute_new_data(new_data)`. This contains the raw data in `new_data` as well as the imputed values. 
  
## The Basics  
  
We will be looking at a few simple examples of
imputation. We need to load the packages, and define the data:

``` {python SETUP}
import miceforest as mf
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load data and introduce missing values
iris = pd.concat(load_iris(as_frame=True,return_X_y=True),axis=1)
iris.rename({"target": "species"}, inplace=True, axis=1)
iris['species'] = iris['species'].astype('category')
iris_amp = mf.ampute_data(iris,perc=0.25,random_state=1991)
```


### Basic Examples  
If you only want to create a single imputed dataset, you can set the `datasets` parameter to 1:
``` {python SIMPLESINGLE}
# Create kernel. 
kds = mf.ImputationKernel(
  iris_amp,
  datasets=1,
  save_all_iterations=True,
  random_state=1991
)

# Run the MICE algorithm for 2 iterations
kds.mice(2)

# Return the completed dataset.
iris_complete = kds.complete_data(0)
print(iris_complete.isnull().sum())
```  
There are also an array of plotting functions available, these are discussed below in the section [Diagnostic Plotting](https://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest#Diagnostic-Plotting).  


We usually don't want to impute just a single dataset. In statistics, multiple imputation is a process by which the uncertainty/other effects caused by missing values can be examined by creating multiple different imputed datasets. `ImputationKernel` can contain an arbitrary number of different datasets, all of which have gone through mutually exclusive imputation processes:
``` {python SIMPLEMULTI}
# Create kernel. 
kernel = mf.ImputationKernel(
  iris_amp,
  datasets=4,
  save_all_iterations=True,
  random_state=1
)

# Run the MICE algorithm for 2 iterations on each of the datasets
kernel.mice(2)

# Printing the kernel will show you some high level information.
print(kernel)
```

After we have run mice, we can obtain our completed dataset directly from the kernel:
``` {python COMPLETE_NOCOPY}
completed_dataset = kernel.complete_data(dataset=0, inplace=False)
print(completed_dataset.isnull().sum(0))
```
Using `inplace=False` returns a copy of the completed data. Since the raw data is already stored in `kernel.working_data`, you can set `inplace=True` to complete the data without returning a copy:
``` {python COMPLETE_COPY}
kernel.complete_data(dataset=0, inplace=True)
print(kernel.working_data.isnull().sum(0))
```

### Controlling Tree Growth
Parameters can be passed directly to lightgbm in several different ways. Parameters you wish to apply globally to every model can simply be passed as kwargs to `mice`:
``` {python TREEGROWTH}
# Run the MICE algorithm for 1 more iteration on the kernel with new parameters
kernel.mice(iterations=1,n_estimators=50)
```

You can also pass pass variable-specific arguments to `variable_parameters` in mice. For instance, let's say you noticed the imputation of the `[species]` column was taking a little longer, because it is multiclass. You could decrease the n_estimators specifically for that column with:
``` {python TREEGROWTH2}
# Run the MICE algorithm for 2 more iterations on the kernel 
kernel.mice(
  iterations=1,
  variable_parameters={'species': {'n_estimators': 25}},
  n_estimators=50
)
```

In this scenario, any parameters specified in `variable_parameters` takes presidence over the kwargs. 

### Preserving Data Assumptions
If your data contains count data, or any other data which can be parameterized by lightgbm, you can simply specify that variable to be modeled with the corresponding objective function. For example, let's pretend `sepal width (cm)` is a count field which can be parameterized by a Poisson distribution:
``` {python DIFFOBJECTIVE}
# Create kernel. 
cust_kernel = mf.ImputationKernel(
  iris_amp,
  datasets=1,
  random_state=1
)

cust_kernel.mice(
  iterations=1, 
  variable_parameters={'sepal width (cm)': {'objective': 'poisson'}}
)
```

Other nice parameters like `monotone_constraints` can also be passed.  

### Imputing with Gradient Boosted Trees
Since any arbitrary parameters can be passed to `lightgbm.train()`, it is possible to change the algrorithm entirely. This can be done simply like so:
``` {python GBDT}
# Create kernel. 
kds_gbdt = mf.ImputationKernel(
  iris_amp,
  datasets=1,
  save_all_iterations=True,
  random_state=1991
)

# We need to add a small minimum hessian, or lightgbm will complain:
kds_gbdt.mice(iterations=1, boosting='gbdt', min_sum_hessian_in_leaf=0.01)

# Return the completed kernel data
completed_data = kds_gbdt.complete_data(dataset=0)
```  
Note: It is HIGHLY recommended to run parameter tuning if using gradient boosted trees. The parameter tuning process returns the optimal number of iterations, and usually results in much more useful parameter sets. See the section [Tuning Parameters](https://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest#Tuning-Parameters) for more details.  

### Imputing New Data with Existing Models

Multiple Imputation can take a long time. If you wish to impute a
dataset using the MICE algorithm, but don’t have time to train new
models, it is possible to impute new datasets using a `ImputationKernel` object.
The `impute_new_data()` function uses the models collected by `ImputationKernel`
to perform multiple imputation without updating the models at
each iteration:

``` {python IMPUTENEWDATA}
# Our 'new data' is just the first 15 rows of iris_amp
from datetime import datetime

# Define our new data as the first 15 rows
new_data = iris_amp.iloc[range(15)]

# Imputing new data can often be made faster by 
# first compiling candidate predictions
kernel.compile_candidate_preds()

start_t = datetime.now()
new_data_imputed = kernel.impute_new_data(new_data=new_data)
print(f"New Data imputed in {(datetime.now() - start_t).total_seconds()} seconds")
```

All of the imputation parameters (variable_schema, mean_match_candidates, etc) will be
carried over from the original `ImputationKernel` object. When mean matching,
the candidate values are pulled from the original kernel dataset. To impute new data,
the ```save_models``` parameter in ```ImputationKernel``` must be > 0. If 
```save_models == 1```, the model from the latest iteration is saved for each variable.
If ```save_models > 1```, the model from each iteration is saved. This allows for new
data to be imputed in a more similar fashion to the original mice procedure.  
  
  
### Saving and Loading Kernels  

Kernels can be saved using the `.save_kernel()` method, and then loaded again using the `utils.load_kernel()` function. Internally, this procedure uses `blosc` and `dill` packages to do the following:  

1. Convert working data to parquet bytes (if it is a pandas dataframe)
2. Serialize the kernel  
3. Compress this serialization  
4. Save to a file  
  
### Implementing sklearn Pipelines  

kernels can be fit into sklearn pipelines to impute training and scoring datasets:  

``` {python PIPELINE}
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
import miceforest as mf

# Define our data
X, y = make_classification(random_state=0)

# Ampute and split the training data
X = mf.utils.ampute_data(X)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)

# Initialize our miceforest kernel. datasets parameter should be 1,
# we don't want to return multiple datasets.
pipe_kernel = mf.ImputationKernel(X_train, datasets=1)

# Define our pipeline
pipe = Pipeline([
    ('impute', pipe_kernel),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
])

# Fit on and transform our training data.
# Only use 2 iterations of mice.
X_train_t = pipe.fit_transform(
    X_train,
    y_train,
    impute__iterations=2
)

# Transform the test data as well
X_test_t = pipe.transform(X_test)

# Show that neither now have missing values.
assert not np.any(np.isnan(X_train_t))
assert not np.any(np.isnan(X_test_t))
```


## Advanced Features  
There are many ways to alter the imputation procedure to fit your specific dataset.

### Customizing the Imputation Process

It is possible to heavily customize our imputation procedure by variable. By
passing a named list to `variable_schema`, you can specify the predictors for each
variable to impute. You can also specify `mean_match_candidates` and `data_subset`
by variable by passing a dict of valid values, with variable names as keys. You 
can even replace the entire default mean matching function if you wish:

``` {python CUSTOMSCHEMA}
var_sch = {
    'sepal width (cm)': ['species','petal width (cm)'],
    'petal width (cm)': ['species','sepal length (cm)']
}
var_mmc = {
    'sepal width (cm)': 5,
    'petal width (cm)': 0
}
var_mms = {
  'sepal width (cm)': 50
}

cust_kernel = mf.ImputationKernel(
    iris_amp,
    datasets=3,
    variable_schema=var_sch,
    mean_match_candidates=var_mmc,
    data_subset=var_mms
)
cust_kernel.mice(1)
```
  

### Building Models on Nonmissing Data  
The MICE process itself is used to impute missing data in a dataset. However, sometimes a variable can be fully recognized in the training data, but needs to be imputed later on in a different dataset. It is possible to train models to impute variables even if they have no missing values by setting `train_nonmissing=True`. In this case, `variable_schema` is treated as the list of variables to train models on. `imputation_order` only affects which variables actually have their values imputed, it does not affect which variables have models trained:
``` {python TRAIN_NONMISSING}
orig_missing_cols = ["sepal length (cm)", "sepal width (cm)"]
new_missing_cols = ["sepal length (cm)", "sepal width (cm)", "species"]

# Training data only contains 2 columns with missing data
iris_amp2 = iris.copy()
iris_amp2[orig_missing_cols] = mf.ampute_data(
  iris_amp2[orig_missing_cols],
  perc=0.25,
  random_state=1991
)

# Specify that models should also be trained for species column
var_sch = new_missing_cols

cust_kernel = mf.ImputationKernel(
    iris_amp2,
    datasets=1,
    variable_schema=var_sch,
    train_nonmissing=True
)
cust_kernel.mice(1)

# New data has missing values in species column
iris_amp2_new = iris.iloc[range(10),:].copy()
iris_amp2_new[new_missing_cols] = mf.ampute_data(
  iris_amp2_new[new_missing_cols],
  perc=0.25,
  random_state=1991
)

# Species column can still be imputed
iris_amp2_new_imp = cust_kernel.impute_new_data(iris_amp2_new)
iris_amp2_new_imp.complete_data(0).isnull().sum()
```

Here, we knew that the species column in our new data would need to be imputed. Therefore, we specified that a model should be built for all 3 variables in the `variable_schema` (passing a dict of target - feature pairs would also have worked).


### Tuning Parameters
`miceforest` allows you to tune the parameters on a kernel dataset. These parameters can then be used to build the models in future iterations of mice. In its most simple invocation, you can just call the function with the desired optimization steps:
``` {python TUNEPARAMETERS}
# Using the first ImputationKernel in kernel to tune parameters
# with the default settings.
optimal_parameters, losses = kernel.tune_parameters(
  dataset=0,
  optimization_steps=5
)

# Run mice with our newly tuned parameters.
kernel.mice(1, variable_parameters=optimal_parameters)

# The optimal parameters are kept in ImputationKernel.optimal_parameters:
print(optimal_parameters)
```
This will perform 10 fold cross validation on random samples of parameters. By default, all variables models are tuned. If you are curious about the default parameter space that is searched within, check out the `miceforest.default_lightgbm_parameters` module.  

The parameter tuning is pretty flexible. If you wish to set some model parameters static, or to change the bounds that are searched in, you can simply pass this information to either the `variable_parameters` parameter, `**kwbounds`, or both:
``` {python TUNEPARAMETERS2}
# Using a complicated setup:
optimal_parameters, losses = kernel.tune_parameters(
  dataset=0,
  variables = ['sepal width (cm)','species','petal width (cm)'],
  variable_parameters = {
    'sepal width (cm)': {'bagging_fraction': 0.5},
    'species': {'bagging_freq': (5,10)}
  },
  optimization_steps=5,
  extra_trees = [True, False]
)

kernel.mice(1, variable_parameters=optimal_parameters)

```
In this example, we did a few things - we specified that only `sepal width (cm)`, `species`, and `petal width (cm)` should be tuned. We also specified some specific parameters in `variable_parameters.` Notice that `bagging_fraction` was passed as a scalar, `0.5`. This means that, for the variable `sepal width (cm)`, the parameter `bagging_fraction` will be set as that number and not be tuned. We did the opposite for `bagging_freq`. We specified bounds that the process should search in. We also passed the argument `extra_trees` as a list. Since it was passed to **kwbounds, this parameter will apply to all variables that are being tuned. Passing values as a list tells the process that it should randomly sample values from the list, instead of treating them as set of counts to search within.

The tuning process follows these rules for different parameter values it finds:  
 
* Scalar: That value is used, and not tuned.  
* Tuple: Should be length 2. Treated as the lower and upper bound to search in.  
* List: Treated as a distinct list of values to try randomly.  

### On Reproducibility
`miceforest` allows for different "levels" of reproducibility, global and record-level.

##### **Global Reproducibility**  
Global reproducibility ensures that the same values will be imputed if the same code is run multiple times. To ensure global reproducibility, all the user needs to do is set a `random_state` when the kernel is initialized.

##### **Record-Level Reproducibility**  
Sometimes we want to obtain reproducible imputations at the record level, without having to pass the same dataset. This is possible by passing a list of record-specific seeds to the `random_seed_array` parameter. This is useful if imputing new data multiple times, and you would like imputations for each row to match each time it is imputed.
``` {python REPRODUCE_SEEDS}
# Define seeds for the data, and impute iris
random_seed_array = np.random.randint(9999, size=150)
iris_imputed = kernel.impute_new_data(
    iris_amp,
    random_state=4,
    random_seed_array=random_seed_array
)

# Select a random sample
new_inds = np.random.choice(150, size=15)
new_data = iris_amp.loc[new_inds]
new_seeds = random_seed_array[new_inds]
new_imputed = kernel.impute_new_data(
    new_data,
    random_state=4,
    random_seed_array=new_seeds
)

# We imputed the same values for the 15 values each time,
# because each record was associated with the same seed.
assert new_imputed.complete_data(0).equals(iris_imputed.complete_data(0).loc[new_inds])

```  

Note that record-level reproducibility is only possible in the `impute_new_data` function, there are no guarantees of record-level reproducibility in imputations between the kernel and new data.

### How to Make the Process Faster  
Multiple Imputation is one of the most robust ways to handle missing data - but it can take a long time. There are several strategies you can use to decrease the time a process takes to run:  
 
* Decrease `data_subset`. By default all non-missing datapoints for each variable are used to train the model and perform mean matching. This can cause the model training nearest-neighbors search to take a long time for large data. A subset of these points can be searched instead by using `data_subset`.  
* In the `prediction_dtypes` parameter, specify `float16` for numeric columns if it suits your data. The default mean matching functions are optimized for fast searches through `float16` arrays. You will lose some granularity, but it is often worth the additional speed.  
* If you need to impute new data faster, compile the predictions with the `compile_candidate_preds` method. This stores the predictions for each model, so it does not need to be re-calculated at each iteration.  
* Convert your data to a numpy array. Numpy arrays are much faster to index. While indexing overhead is avoided as much as possible, there is no getting around it. Consider comverting to `float32` datatype as well, as it will cause the resulting object to take up much less memory.
* Decrease `mean_match_candidates`. The maximum number of neighbors that are considered with the default parameters is 10. However, for large datasets, this can still be an expensive operation. Consider explicitly setting `mean_match_candidates` lower.
* Use different lightgbm parameters. lightgbm is usually not the problem, however if a certain variable has a large number of classes, then the max number of trees actually grown is (# classes) * (n_estimators). You can specifically decrease the bagging fraction or n_estimators for large multi-class variables, or grow less trees in general.  
* Use a faster mean matching function. The default mean matching function uses the scipy.Spatial.KDtree algorithm. There are faster alternatives out there, if you think mean matching is the holdup.


### Imputing Data In Place  
It is possible to run the entire process without copying the dataset. If `copy_data=False`, then the data is referenced directly:
```{python IMPUTE_NOCOPY}
kernel_inplace = mf.ImputationKernel(
  iris_amp,
  datasets=1,
  copy_data=False
)
kernel_inplace.mice(2)
```
Note, that this probably won't (but could) change the original dataset in undesirable ways. Throughout the `mice` procedure, imputed values are stored directly in the original data. At the end, the missing values are put back as `np.NaN`.

We can also complete our original data in place:
```{python COMPLETE_REFERENCE}
kernel_inplace.complete_data(dataset=0, inplace=True)
print(iris_amp.isnull().sum(0))
```
This is useful if the dataset is large, and copies can't be made in memory.  
  
## Diagnostic Plotting

As of now, miceforest has four diagnostic plots available.

### Distribution of Imputed-Values  
We probably want to know how the imputed values are distributed. We can
plot the original distribution beside the imputed distributions in each 
dataset by using the `plot_imputed_distributions` method of an
`ImputationKernel` object:
``` {python PLOT_DIST,eval=FALSE}
kernel.plot_imputed_distributions(wspace=0.3,hspace=0.3)
```
```{r,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/distributions.png")
```  

The red line is the original data, and each black line are the imputed
values of each dataset.

### Convergence of Correlation  
  
We are probably interested in knowing how our values between datasets
converged over the iterations. The `plot_correlations` method shows you
a boxplot of the correlations between imputed values in every
combination of datasets, at each iteration. This allows you to see how
correlated the imputations are between datasets, as well as the convergence
over iterations:

``` {python PLOT_CORRCONVERGENCE,eval=FALSE}
kernel.plot_correlations()
```
```{r,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/plot_corr.png")
```

### Variable Importance  
We also may be interested in which variables were used to impute each variable. We can
plot this information by using the `plot_feature_importance` method.  
``` {python PLOT_FEATIMP,eval=FALSE}
kernel.plot_feature_importance(dataset=0, annot=True,cmap="YlGnBu",vmin=0, vmax=1)
```
```{r,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/var_imp.png")
```

The numbers shown are returned from the `lightgbm.Booster.feature_importance()` function. Each square represents the importance of the column variable in imputing the row variable.  

### Mean Convergence  
If our data is not missing completely at random, we may see that it takes a few iterations for our models to get the distribution of imputations right.
We can plot the average value of our imputations to see if this is occurring:
``` {python PLOT_MEANCON,eval=FALSE}
kernel.plot_mean_convergence(wspace=0.3, hspace=0.4)
```
```{r,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/mean_convergence.png")
```  
  
Our data was missing completely at random, so we don't see any convergence occurring here.

## Using the Imputed Data

To return the imputed data simply use the `complete_data` method:
```{python completeData}
dataset_1 = kernel.complete_data(0)
```  
This will return a single specified dataset. Multiple datasets are typically created so that
some measure of confidence around each prediction can be created.  
  
Since we know what the original data looked like, we can cheat and see how well the imputations
compare to the original data:
```{python IMP_PERFORMANCE}
acclist = []
for iteration in range(kernel.iteration_count()+1):
    species_na_count = kernel.na_counts[4]
    compdat = kernel.complete_data(dataset=0,iteration=iteration)
    
    # Record the accuract of the imputations of species.
    acclist.append(
      round(1-sum(compdat['species'] != iris['species'])/species_na_count,2)
    )

# acclist shows the accuracy of the imputations
# over the iterations.
print(acclist)
```
In this instance, we went from a ~32% accuracy (which is expected with random sampling) to an accuracy of ~65% after the first iteration. This isn't the best example, since our kernel so far has been abused to show the flexability of the imputation procedure.

  
## The MICE Algorithm
Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations 'fills in' (imputes) missing data in a dataset through an iterative series of predictive models. In each iteration, each specified variable in the dataset is imputed using the other variables in the dataset. These iterations should be run until it appears that convergence has been met.  

  
```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/MICEalgorithm.png")
```  

This process is continued until all specified variables have been imputed. Additional iterations can be run if it appears that the average imputed values have not converged, although no more than 5 iterations are usually necessary.


### Common Use Cases  
##### **Data Leakage:**  
MICE is particularly useful if missing values are associated with the target variable in a way that introduces leakage. For instance, let's say you wanted to model customer retention at the time of sign up. A certain variable is collected at sign up or 1 month after sign up. The absence of that variable is a data leak, since it tells you that the customer did not retain for 1 month.

##### **Funnel Analysis:**  
Information is often collected at different stages of a 'funnel'. MICE can be used to make educated guesses about the characteristics of entities at different points in a funnel.  

##### **Confidence Intervals:**  
MICE can be used to impute missing values, however it is important to keep in mind that these imputed values are a prediction. Creating multiple datasets with different imputed values allows you to do two types of inference:  

* Imputed Value Distribution: A profile can be built for each imputed value, allowing you to make statements about the likely distribution of that value.  
* Model Prediction Distribution: With multiple datasets, you can build multiple models and create a distribution of predictions for each sample. Those samples with imputed values which were not able to be imputed with much confidence would have a larger variance in their predictions.  
  

### Predictive Mean Matching
```miceforest``` can make use of a procedure called predictive mean matching (PMM) to select which values are imputed. PMM involves selecting a datapoint from the original, nonmissing data which has a predicted value close to the predicted value of the missing sample. The closest N (```mean_match_candidates``` parameter) values are chosen as candidates, from which a value is chosen at random. This can be specified on a column-by-column basis. Going into more detail from our example above, we see how this works in practice:  

  
```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/PMM.png")
```  
  

This method is very useful if you have a variable which needs imputing which has any of the following characteristics:  

* Multimodal  
* Integer  
* Skewed  
  
### Effects of Mean Matching  
As an example, let's construct a dataset with some of the above characteristics:
```{python FAKEDATA, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8,eval=FALSE}
randst = np.random.RandomState(1991)
# random uniform variable
nrws = 1000
uniform_vec = randst.uniform(size=nrws)

def make_bimodal(mean1,mean2,size):
    bimodal_1 = randst.normal(size=nrws, loc=mean1)
    bimodal_2 = randst.normal(size=nrws, loc=mean2)
    bimdvec = []
    for i in range(size):
        bimdvec.append(randst.choice([bimodal_1[i], bimodal_2[i]]))
    return np.array(bimdvec)

# Make 2 Bimodal Variables
close_bimodal_vec = make_bimodal(2,-2,nrws)
far_bimodal_vec = make_bimodal(3,-3,nrws)


# Highly skewed variable correlated with Uniform_Variable
skewed_vec = np.exp(uniform_vec*randst.uniform(size=nrws)*3) + randst.uniform(size=nrws)*3

# Integer variable correlated with Close_Bimodal_Variable and Uniform_Variable
integer_vec = np.round(uniform_vec + close_bimodal_vec/3 + randst.uniform(size=nrws)*2)

# Make a DataFrame
dat = pd.DataFrame(
    {
    'uniform_var':uniform_vec,
    'close_bimodal_var':close_bimodal_vec,
    'far_bimodal_var':far_bimodal_vec,
    'skewed_var':skewed_vec,
    'integer_var':integer_vec
    }
)

# Ampute the data.
ampdat = mf.ampute_data(dat,perc=0.25,random_state=randst)

# Plot the original data
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
g = sns.PairGrid(dat)
g.map(plt.scatter,s=5)
```
```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width='600px'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/dataset.png")
```  
We can see how our variables are distributed and correlated in the graph above. Now let's run our imputation process twice, once using mean matching, and once using the model prediction.  
```{r,eval=FALSE}
kernelmeanmatch = mf.ImputationKernel(ampdat, datasets=1,mean_match_candidates=5)
kernelmodeloutput = mf.ImputationKernel(ampdat, datasets=1,mean_match_candidates=0)

kernelmeanmatch.mice(2)
kernelmodeloutput.mice(2)
```  

Let's look at the effect on the different variables.

##### With Mean Matching
```{python,eval=FALSE}
kernelmeanmatch.plot_imputed_distributions(wspace=0.2,hspace=0.4)
```
```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width='600px'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/meanmatcheffects.png")
```  

##### Without Mean Matching
``` {python,eval=FALSE}
kernelmodeloutput.plot_imputed_distributions(wspace=0.2,hspace=0.4)
```
```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width='600px'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest/master/examples/nomeanmatching.png")
```  

You can see the effects that mean matching has, depending on the distribution of the data. 
Simply returning the value from the model prediction, while it may provide a better 'fit',
will not provide imputations with a similair distribution to the original. This may be
beneficial, depending on your goal.
